      <description>Introduction Seasonality is one of the most influencing pattern on earth. Global variation in seasonal climate is arguably the most dominant external driver in natural systems that underpins the formation of the earthâ€™s biomes and almost all biological processes therein. Reproduction, food-web structures, host-pathogen interactions, movements, all vary with the seasons. Yet not only the living world is affected, geological processes such as erosion, river dynamics, earthquakes are somewhat driven or triggered by seasonal pattern such as snowmelt, monsoon and rainfall.</description>
